# CLY to STL Converter

A web-based converter for FreeForm Workspace (.cly) files to STL format for 3D printing. This project includes comprehensive file analysis tools and enhanced parsing strategies for attempting to breakdown and export the .cly format.

## Features

- **Web Interface**: Modern drag-and-drop interface with gradient background
- **Multiple Formats**: Convert to ASCII or Binary STL
- **Large File Support**: Handles files up to 500MB+ (change to suit your needs)
- **Real-time Progress**: Visual feedback during conversion
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Deep file structure analysis with magic number detection
- **Enhanced Parsing**: Multiple fallback strategies for mesh extraction
- **Detailed Logging**: Extensive logs for reverse engineering and debugging

## Current Status

### **Recently Completed:**
- **Comprehensive File Analysis**: analysis output with magic numbers, ASCII strings, and chunk patterns
- **Enhanced Parser Architecture**: Multiple mesh extraction strategies with fallback methods
- **FreeStyle Format Support**: Handles "FreeStyle Workspace (FWP)" format (non standard CLY)
- **Real Mesh Extraction**: Successfully extracts actual vertices and faces from .cly files
- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved AttributeError, TypeError, and JSON parsing issues
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient background and improved user experience
- **Analysis Integration**: Parser uses insights from comprehensive file analysis

### **Current Limitations:**
The conversion algorithm is **still a work in progress** and needs significant improvement:

1. **Limited Mesh Extraction**:
   - The file contains much more geometry data then detected in testing
   - Need better pattern recognition for vertex/face data structures

2. **Incomplete Format Understanding**: 
   - .cly files use proprietary FreeForm format with complex binary structures
   - Some data chunks remain unidentified despite comprehensive analysis
   - Need to decode the relationship between file size and extracted geometry

3. **Pattern Recognition Gaps**:
   - Analysis found 150M+ potential data chunks (in test file) but only extracted partial geometry
   - Common patterns found in sample .cly file analysed, like 'aaaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbb' suggest structured data missing from analysis
   - Need better algorithms to identify and parse mesh data sections

4. **Validation Needed**:
   - Current extraction produces geometrically valid but potentially incomplete meshes
   - Need more comparisons with original FreeForm software output for accuracy verification

## Quick Start

### Windows
1. **Setup (one-time):**
   ```batch
   setup.bat
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```batch
   run.bat
   ```

### Linux/Mac
1. **Setup (one-time):**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

3. **Open your browser to:** `http://localhost:5000`

## Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate virtual environment:**
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Converter Strategies

The converter uses a multi-strategy approach:

1. **Strategy 1 - Mesh Sections**: Scans for vertex count patterns and validates coordinates
2. **Strategy 2 - Pattern-Based**: Searches for mesh data near identified patterns
3. **Strategy 3 - Dimension-Based**: Validates vertices within expected model bounds
4. **Fallback Methods**: Multiple approaches ensure maximum extraction success
